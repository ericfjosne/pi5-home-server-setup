# Configure networking

## Disable Wifi & bluetooth

We don't want any radio enabled during operations.

To achieve this, edit the raspberry pi boot config

```sh
sudo nano /boot/firmware/config.txt
```

Add the following lines (Raspberry pi 5 specific) under the `[all]`

```properties
dtoverlay=disable-wifi-pi5
dtoverlay=disable-bt-pi5
```

## Configure interfaces via NetworkManager

### Clear existing connections

List currently active connections

```sh
sudo nmcli -p connection show
```

Delete them, based on UUID or name

```sh

sudo nmcli connection delete [UUID]
sudo nmcli connection delete netplan-eth0
```

Confirm the connection configuration was deleted

```sh
sudo nmcli -p connection show
```

### Set up the 2 wired connections (uplink & local)

#### Uplink

Configure ip address on network interface `eth2` as auto (retrieved via DHCP)

```sh
sudo nmcli connection add type ethernet con-name eth2 ifname eth2 ipv4.method auto
```

Bring physical interface `eth2` up

```sh
sudo nmcli connection up eth2
```

#### Local network

For this setup, we want to have the ability to run virtual machines on the server and have them exposed on the local network. Those virtual machines will need to share the same IP address range as all physical machines connected to the local network. To achieve this, we need to configure a bridge network interface `br0`, and add our physical interface `eth1` as bridge slave.

Create bridge interface `br0` and add the `eth1` interface to it as slave

```sh
sudo nmcli connection add type bridge con-name br0 ifname br0
sudo nmcli connection add type bridge-slave ifname eth1 master br0
```

Disable [Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanning_Tree_Protocol) support on the bridge, to avoid unnecessary packet noise from the interface, and configure ip address:

```sh
sudo nmcli connection modify br0 bridge.stp no
sudo nmcli connection modify br0 ipv4.addresses 10.0.0.1/24
sudo nmcli connection modify br0 ipv4.method manual
```

Bring physical interface `eth1` down (just in case)

```sh
sudo nmcli connection down eth1
```

Bring bridge interface `br0` up

```sh
sudo nmcli connection up br0
```

### Check connection status

Running the following command

```sh
nmcli dev status
```

Should give the following output

```sh
DEVICE  TYPE      STATE                   CONNECTION
eth2    ethernet  connected               eth2
br0     bridge    connected               br0
eth1    ethernet  connected               bridge-slave-eth1
lo      loopback  connected (externally)  lo
eth0    ethernet  unavailable             --
```

Running the following command

```sh
nmcli connection show
```

Should give the following output

```sh
NAME                         UUID             TYPE      DEVICE
eth2                         [REDACTED_UUID]  ethernet  eth2
br0                          [REDACTED_UUID]  bridge    br0
bridge-slave-eth1            [REDACTED_UUID]  ethernet  eth1
lo                           [REDACTED_UUID]  loopback  lo
eth1                         [REDACTED_UUID]  ethernet  --
```

Running the following command

```sh
ifconfig
```

Should give the following output
